We have powerful and easy to use tools that can vastly improve the quality and security of the code we use everyday.

Code written in C and C++ is often riddled with bugs in the memory management. Out of bounds accesses, use after free errors and other issues can hamper the security and stability of applications. Unfortunately many free software developers don't use freely available tools that easily allow finding and eliminating many of these bugs. The talk will encourage developers to change that and integrate these tools into their development process.

### What do I need to bring?

1. Bring the output of `gpg --fingerprint $YOUR_KEY_ID` on some pieces of paper to hand out.
2. (Optional) Bring some government-issued identification paper (passport, drivers license, etc.). The ID should contain a picture of yourself. You can leave this out, but then it will be a bit harder for others to verify your key properly.

BLE provides versatile wireless communication at a very low
power consumption, especially compared to classic Bluetooth
and WiFi.

It has a wide range of uses where proximity detection is used
for a lot of applications such as alerting when a keychain
goes out of range or requesting alerts from lost objects.  Among
consumer products, Apple iBeacons is a notable application of
the technology.  However, it is also used for human input devices
such as mice and keyboards as well as various forms of sensors,
e.g. temperature, heart rate, etc.

BLE enables devices to run off coincell batteries for years
while retaining connections or doing periodic broadcasting.
This makes the technology appealing for the maker community
for applications that are power-constrained, e.g. due to having
a limited power-budget (say, running off a small PV-cell) or
running off a battery.

This talk explains how the low power consumption is achieved,
what the possible topologies are, and how this affects the types
of applications you can build on top.  Finally, a low-level
demonstration of interfacing with a BLE controller is performed.

TLS is by far the most important cryptographic protocol in use today.
In recent years TLS received much more attention from security
researchers. Implementation errors like Heartbleed and protocol bugs
like BEAST, Lucky Thirteen, DROWN and many more have made headlines.

Faulty implementations can enable attacks. In some cases they can even
be a security risk for uninvolved third parties and endanger the whole
TLS ecosystem. Especially so-called Enterprise devices that have their
own TLS stack are often a reason for concern.

The speaker will give an overview of implementation errors that
happened in various TLS stacks and will shed light on this
underappreciated problem.

Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against
traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal
freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships,
and state security.

People can donate their bandwidth to the Tor network and support human
rights. Many people in Finland have done this.

Especially Tor network needs fast exit nodes which are final nodes before
traffic reaches its destination. Because Tor traffic exits through these
relays, the IP address of the exit relay is interpreted as the source of
the traffic.

If a malicious user employs the Tor network to do something that might be
objectionable or illegal, the exit relay may take the blame. People who run
exit relays should be prepared to deal with complaints, copyright takedown
notices, and the possibility that their servers may attract the attention
of law enforcement agencies.

In Finland, Juha Nurmi has been establishing good relationships with ISPs
and law enforcement agencies to keep Finnish exit nodes online.

proved the existence of true but unprovable sentences in every
reasonable formalization of mathematics.

However, the explicit sentence constructed in the proof was tailored to
cause trouble and therefore was not of much interest to mathematicians
in general. Since then various incompleteness phenomena have been
discovered and many of these (relative) unprovable sentences are of genuine mathematical interest. In recent years Harvey Friedman have taken this enterprise to a new level by constructing sentences about "low level" mathematics and showed that these sentences are provably equivalent to the consistency of axiomatic systems far stronger than classical set theory (ZFC). In this talk I will try to introduce concepts of mathematical logic together with some highlights in the history of incompleteness phenomena and discuss the philosophical implications of these.

Note that these (early 20th century) developments also play an important role in developing the theoretical computer.

Digitalization is on everybodys mind - and so is control and registration

data-silo-systems and piles up sensitive data without securing anything.
Critical Infrastructure is privatized and sold off and secure, analog

Its an evolving Infocalypse, where all info can be manipulated, stolen and
used, our money system, personal data and administrations are doomed in a
world of greedy blackhats, cyberwarfare-troops, autonomous drones,

A lot has happened ever since the German pirates developed the first visions about a dynamic representational democracy. Google and other big players have experimented with the disciplines, and the idea of a more modern form of democracy has grown steadily.

Monday will primarily be focused around The Alternatives experiment with Liquid Democracy and a constructive debate about how liquid democracy can improve The Alternative. Rolf Bjerre leads the process.

Distributed Hash Tables are used as name-lookups in large decentralized
distributed systems
such as peer-to-peer networks and loosely connected machine clusters.
Correctness is
complicated by their distributed nature. This talk presents an
implementation of one such DHT,
written in Erlang, based on the Kademlia data structure. Its unique feature
is that it comes equipped with
a full QuickCheck specification, which semi-formally verifies its correct
behaviour through random
test generation.

The talk focuses on the test aspect of the system, and how one builds
fairly large QuickCheck
specifications for real-world systems, in particular by slicing a large
specification into isolated
parts and then reassembling those parts into a full model. It is intended
to give people an overview
of how to attack larger code bases with (semi-) formal methods.

                abstract='''
GraphQL is a query-language for data, intended for the modern internet
clients on the web and
inside mobile phones, invented inside Facebook around 2012, it is currently
in a draft specification
phase with several open source implementations of the underlying ideas.

The main feature of GraphQL is a shift away from RESTful services where all
of the query
declaration is on the server side, to one where the client is in control
of declaring what it wants.
The result is a system which is easy to work with for the front-end
developer. GraphQL also
supports backward compatibility to earlier client versions. All while being
able to maintain a
security level at least as good as REST. On the server side, GraphQL
provides much the same
benefits, acting as a protocol and contract between the server and client.

This talk presents GraphQL itself, and also presents how one goes about
building an implementation
of the language. The running example is a GraphQL compiler written for
Erlang.

At the same time as society is getting more complex, the amount of data is growing exponentially. How are everyday citizens to relate to National budgets used in the media? I am going to talk about one of the ways I think will make it easier to understand the datasets used in the media.

Towards the end we will open up to debate about how to use these resources or if there are other solutions.

From/Via Copenhagen

There are several ways to get to Bornholm from Copenhagen. A domestic plane departs from Copenhagen Airport, and you can get from Copenhagen Central station by either bus or train via Ystad or the Køge-Rønne ferry connection.

Plane (very fast, most expensive)
    You can check plane departures and book tickets at dat.dk. There are multiple departures daily. The flight takes approximately 25 minutes.
Via Ystad (quick, cheap and easy, crosses Sweden border)
    You can drive over Øresundsbroen to Ystad or you can take the train/bus from Copenhagen Central Station. You can buy train and ferry ticket at dsb.dk (Type in "København H" and "Rønne Havn"). More information about the crossing. The crossing takes 1 hour 20 minutes. In total about 3 hours 15 minutes. Due to recent developments an ID (passport, drivers license or similar) is required when crossing the Denmark/Sweden border.
Via Køge (cheap, slow)
    Take the S-train to Køge Station (you need an "all zones" ticket) or travel by car. The ferry terminal is within walking distance from the station. You can check out prices here. It takes approximately 1 hour to get to Køge. The crossing takes 5 hours 30 minutes.

From Sweden/Malmö

To get to Bornholm from Malmö you may take a train from Malmö to Ystad and the ferry from Ystad to Bornholm.

Skånetrafiken runs trains from Malmö C to Ystad every 30 minutes. Trains leave at 08 and 38 minutes past the hour. Go to skanetrafiken for details.

The ferry from Ystad to Rønne leaves four times per day. Morning: 08:30-09:50 Noon: 12:30-13:50 Afternoon: 16:30-17:50 Evening: 20:30-21:50 Booking the ferry tickets prior to departure can drastically reduce the price. See "Getting from Rønne to the Venue" final step.
From Abroad

If you are going to BornHack from abroad you have different options as well.

Berlin (Germany)
    There are no public transport routes from Berlin to Mukran, Sassnitz ferry terminal on Saturdays, including Aug 27 and Sept 03 the Bornhack start/end dates. Your best bet is to get a train to Dubnitz, Sassnitz station. Unfortunately it is still 1.7km to the actual ferry terminal: map of route. There is a bus, but it only goes once a weekday at 12:28 and not at all on Weekends. You can of course take a taxi. Search for routes Berlin ‐ Dubnitz on bahn.de. At the time of writing, the best route is:
    08:45 Berlin Hbf → train with 2 changes, 50€ for a 2-way return ticket.
    12:52 Sassnitz → taxi, ~14€, 10 min.
    13:00 Mukran-Sassnitz ferry terminal
    If you want to try your luck at a direct route to the ferry terminal, search for routes Berlin ‐ Sassnitz-Mukran Fährhafen on bahn.de or for routes Berlin ‐ Fährhafen Sassnitz on checkmybus.com.
Sassnitz (Germany)
    There is a direct ferry taking cars going from Sassnitz ferry terminal which is 4km away from Sassnitz itself. The company is called BornholmerFærgen and the tickets cost 32€ (outgoing) and 25€ (return). It can also be booked from aferry.co.uk. The ferry departs for Bornholm on Aug 27 at 11:50, 13:30, and returns to Sassnitz on Sept 03 at 08:00, 09:00. Detailed timetable: English, Danish.
Kolobrzeg (Poland)
    There is a passenger ferry from Kolobrzeg to Nexø havn.

Please note that sleeping in the parking lot is not permitted. If you want to sleep in your car/RV/autocamper/caravan please contact us, and we will work something out.
