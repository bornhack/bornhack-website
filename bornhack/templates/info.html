            <h4>From/Via Copenhagen</h4>
            <p>
              There are several ways to get to Bornholm from Copenhagen.
              A domestic plane departs from Copenhagen Airport, and you
              can get from Copenhagen Central station by either bus or
              train via Ystad or the Køge-Rønne ferry connection.
            </p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Plane (very fast, most expensive)</dt>
              <dd>
                You can check plane departures and book tickets at
                <a href="https://www.dat.dk/en/" target="_blank">dat.dk</a>. There are
                multiple departures daily. The flight takes approximately
                25 minutes.
              </dd>

              <dt>Via Ystad (quick, cheap and easy, crosses Sweden border)</dt>
              <dd>
                You can drive over Øresundsbroen to Ystad or you can
                take the train/bus from Copenhagen Central Station. You
                can buy train and ferry ticket at
                <a href="http://www.dsb.dk/en/#open" target="_blank">dsb.dk</a> (Type

                The crossing takes 1 hour 20 minutes. In total about
                3 hours 15 minutes. Due to recent developments an ID
                (passport, drivers license or similar) is required when
                crossing the Denmark/Sweden border.
              </dd>

              <dt>Via Køge (cheap, slow)</dt>
              <dd>
                Take the S-train to Køge Station (you need an "all zones"
                ticket) or travel by car. The ferry terminal is within
                walking distance from the station. You can check out
                prices

                There are no public transport routes from Berlin to Mukran, Sassnitz
                ferry terminal on Saturdays, including Aug 27 and Sept 03 the

                Dubnitz, Sassnitz station. Unfortunately it is still 1.7km to the actual ferry terminal:

              BornHack is first and foremost a tent camp. You need to
              bring a tent to sleep in. Most people go with some friends
              and make a camp somewhere at the venue. See also the section
              on Villages - you might be able to find some likeminded
              people to camp with.

              BornHack has around 1 toilet per 10 participants. The toilets
              are unisex like the showers. The toilets will also be cleaned
              twice per day, so they should be nice. Like the showers, the
              toilets are also permanent installations inside a brick house.
              A year may come when we have to use porta potties at BornHack,
              but it is not this year!

              We know that hackers like to cook for themselves, not just
              because of vegetarians/vegan diets. Everyone is encouraged

              are <b>strictly forbidden</b> on the camp grounds for fire
              safety reasons. If you want to cook with coal use the big
              barbeque in the food area! Gas and electrical barbeques are
              allowed in villages, as are gas burners and cooking plates / hotplates.

              we recommend to do so with static IP's. You can also use
              static configuration on clients to avoid attacks involving
              rogue DHCP servers and similar.

              At BornHack we have bicycles available to borrow for free.
              They come with helmets, locks and lights. Noone should spend a
              week on Bornholm without seeing a bit more of the island. If you
              want to go sightseeing, grocery shopping, or just feel like
              riding a bicycle, you should take advantage of this offer.

              All participants at BornHack 2016 will receive an electronic
              name badge. The badge was designed by Thomas Flummer from
              Copenhagen makerspace Labitat, and is sponsored by TykTech.

              Assembling the bagde is easy and takes around 15-30 minutes,
              depending on your soldering experience. We have a bunch of
              soldering irons available you can borrow in case you are
              not bringing your own.

              The badge has a large prototyping area to hack around with,
              both through-hole and surface-mount. During BornHack we are
              excited to see what kind of badge modifications our participants
              come up with. At the end of the week we will pick the three winners
              of this years badge hacking contest. The winners will receive
              fabulous prices and eternal fame!
