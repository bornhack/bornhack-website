  This is a list of the {{ view.camp.title }}  sponsors. An event like BornHack
  can not be built on hard work and good intentions alone - it would simply not
  have been possible without the financial help from these organisations. Thank
  you, we are immensely grateful!

<h2>Becoming a {{ camp.title }} Sponsor</h2>
<p>We are looking for sponsors to help us make {{ camp.title }} as
unforgettable as the previous ones. If you would like to sponsor us do not hesitate
to contact us at <a
href="mailto:sponsors@bornhack.dk">sponsors@bornhack.dk</a>. If you work for an
organisation or company that you believe might be able and willing to sponsor
{{ camp.title }} please direct the right people to this page.</p>

<h3>The Concept</h3>
<p>BornHack is an outdoor tent camping festival with a focus on technology
and society, and how the two interact. The idea and basic concept of BornHack
comes from participation in similar camps in Germany and the Netherlands. These
events have huge traction (thousands of participants, sells out fast) and has
inspired us to make BornHack.</p>

<h3>The Organisers</h3>
<p>BornHack is put together by a group of people from Denmark employed
primarily in the IT industry. The organiser group share a desire to set up a
forum where people with different interests in IT and technology can come
together to share ideas and socialise. Several of the organisers have
previously been (or are still) involved in organising conferences such as <a
  href="https://opensourcedays.org/">Open Source Days</a>.</p>

<h3>Location and Format</h3>
<p>For {{ camp.title }} we will be inviting up to 500 paying guests for a full
week, the ambition is to grow the number of attendees over the coming
years. It will take place at <a href="http://jarlsgaard.dk">Jarlsgaard</a>
on Bornholm, Denmark, where we have a great venue with a fiber connection to the
outside world.</p>

<h3>Sponsorship</h3>
<p>A sponsorship can be in the range of 5000 DKK and up. You get
to have a logo of your choice placed on our website in the sponsors
section, and we can also display tasteful signs or banners in or
around our speakers tent.</p>

<p>Sponsors often prefer to sponsor a certain area or event at the
camp, where we will figure out an appropriate display in cooperation
with you. Suggested sponsorships include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bar area (sound system, lighting, decorations, building materials, inventory)</li>
  <li>Lounge area (couches, hammocks, decoration)</li>
  <li>Food area (renting barbeques and buying charcoal)</li>
  <li>Speakers tent(s)</li>
  <li>Sound system in speakers tent(s)</li>
  <li>Shuttle buses</li>
  <li>Insurance</li>
  <li>Toilet facilities</li>
  <li>Coffee cart</li>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you have other ideas you would be interested in sponsoring, reach out to us on
<a href="mailto:sponsors@bornhack.dk">sponsors@bornhack.dk</a>
and we can talk about it. Cash sponsorships are also very welcome.</p>
