This module overrides the Range.__and__ function, so that it returns a boolean value
based on if the two objects overlap.
The rationale behind this is that it mirrors the `range && range` operator in postgres.
There are tests for this, that hit the database with randomly generated ranges and ensure
that the database and this method agree upon the results.
There is also a more complete `isempty()` method, which examines the bounds types and values,
and determines if the object is indeed empty. This is required when python-created range objects
are dealt with, as these are not normalised the same way that postgres does.
