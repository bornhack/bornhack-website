Hi,

A new reimbursement {{ reimbursement.pk }} for username {{ reimbursement.reimbursement_user }} was just created. The reimbursement covers {{ reimbursement.expenses.count|add:-1 }} expense(s) for a total amount of DKK {{ reimbursement.amount }}.

Go to backoffice[1] to see the reimbursement including the bank account to use for the transfer.

Have a nice day!

The {{ expense.camp.title }} Team
